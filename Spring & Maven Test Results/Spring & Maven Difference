The performance seems fine either way for me. On loading is the same but that might be impacted by internet speed for loading the tables.

Difference in jar sizes:
Analyster_0.6.8a.jar = 6.6 MB    // with Spring & Maven
Analyster_0.6.8b.jar = 973.8 kb  // removed Spring & Maven (also includes the mysql connector jar)
Analyster_0.6.2.jar = 156.4 kb   // this was before the Spring & Maven ( does not include the mysql connector jar and you can't log in)

The old jar was 156.4 kb - but this jar does not contain the mysql jar - You can tell because you can't log in.

The new jar is 973.8 kb - this one actually contains the mysql jar though

The mysql jar is 834.1 kb

973.8 kb - 834.1 kb = 139.7 kb

139.7 kb is the current project without the mysql jar
